<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Physical activity is any bodily movement produced by the skeletal muscles that uses energy. This includes sports, exercise, and other activities such as playing, walking, household chores, gardening, and dancing. Any activity, be it for work, to walk or cycle to and from places, or as part of leisure time, has a health benefit.</span>

<p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">People who are physically active:</span></p>
<ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_1-0 start">
    <li class="c2 c5"><span class="c0">improve their muscular and cardio-respiratory fitness;</span>
    </li>
    <li class="c2 c5"><span class="c0">improve their bone and functional health;</span></li>
    <li class="c2 c5"><span class="c0">have lower rates of coronary heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes, cancer (including colon and breast cancer), and depression;</span>
    </li>
    <li class="c2 c5"><span class="c0">have a lower risk of falling and of hip or vertebral fractures; and</span>

</ul>
<p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Exercise can be any activity requiring physical effort, carried out to sustain or improve health or fitness, and these can be either prescribed/unsupervised (e.g. 30 minutes of daily walking), supervised (e.g. a weekly supervised group exercise class) or both. Physical activity is also fundamental to energy balance and weight control. </span>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0">A healthy lifestyle includes aerobic physical activity and strength-conditioning exercise aimed at maintaining a good level of fitness throughout pregnancy, without trying to reach peak fitness level or train for athletic competition. Women should choose activities with minimal risk of loss of balance and fetal trauma. Pregnant, postpartum women and persons with cardiac events may need to take extra precautions and seek medical advice before striving to achieve the recommended levels of physical activity. </span>
